<h2>Problem</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Consolidation in the livestock industry has reduced competition and options for farmers.
    <li>Farmers have been forced from family to factory models of production, and open to contracted models of commerce.
    <li>Rural economies, animal welfare, human health, and the environment have all been impacted by these changes.
    <li>Public activism is needed to rebalance the ag economy and build a sustainable, productive future.
</ul>

<h2>Meta-Problem</h2>

</ul>
